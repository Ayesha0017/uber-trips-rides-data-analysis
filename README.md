# uber-trips-rides-data-analysis
Overview
This project analyzes Uber trips data to extract insights into ride patterns, peak hours, popular pickup/drop-off locations, and other useful trends. The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Analysis of ride patterns (e.g., peak hours, days, and months)
Visualization of trip distributions
Geospatial analysis of popular pickup and drop-off locations
Trip duration and distance analysis (if available)
Dataset
The dataset contains Uber ride records with details such as:

Pickup datetime
Dropoff datetime (if available)
Pickup and dropoff locations (latitude & longitude)
Trip distance
Fare amount (if applicable)
Ensure that the dataset (uber_trips.csv) is placed in the project directory before running the analysis.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayesha0017/uber-trips-rides-data-analysis.git
cd uber-trips-analysis

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
python -m venv myenv
# Activate the environment:
# Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate

Usage

Open Uber_Trips_Analysis.ipynb and execute the cells to see the analysis.

Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and incorrect timestamps
Time-based Analysis: Identifying peak hours and busiest days
Location-based Analysis: Finding most popular pickup/drop-off locations
Trip Duration & Distance Analysis: Understanding trip efficiency
Visualizations: Bar plots, histograms, and maps using Seaborn & Folium
