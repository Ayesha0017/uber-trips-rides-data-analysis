# uber-trips-rides-data-analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes Uber trips data to extract insights into ride patterns, peak hours, popular pickup/drop-off locations, and other useful trends. The analysis is performed using Python, leveraging pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.

## Features
*Data cleaning and preprocessing   
*Analysis of ride patterns (e.g., peak hours, days, and months)  
*Visualization of trip distributions  
*Geospatial analysis of popular pickup and drop-off locations  
*Trip duration and distance analysis (if available)  

## Dataset
The dataset (uber_trips.csv) contains the following columns:  
START_DATE â€“ Date and time of pickup  
END_DATE â€“ Date and time of drop-off  
CATEGORY â€“ Business or Personal trip  
START â€“ Pickup location  
STOP â€“ Drop-off location  
MILES â€“ Distance of trip  
PURPOSE â€“ Reason for the ride (e.g., Meeting, Meals, Airport, etc.)  
Ensure that the dataset is correctly formatted before running the analysis.  

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/Ayesha0017/uber-trips-rides-data-analysis.git  
cd uber-trips-analysis      

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
python -m venv myenv  
Activate the environment:  
Windows:   
myenv\Scripts\activate  
macOS/Linux:  
source myenv/bin/activate   

## Usage  
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze the dataset:  
Open Uber_Trips_Analysis.ipynb and execute the cells to see the analysis.  

## Analysis & Insights  
### 1. Countplot Analysis (Category, Purpose, and Time of Day)  
ðŸ”¹ Most of the rides are booked for business purposes.  
ðŸ”¹ People primarily use Uber for Meetings and Meals/Entertainment.  
ðŸ”¹ The majority of cab bookings happen between 10 AM - 5 PM (Afternoon).  

### 2. Correlation Heatmap  
ðŸ”¹ Business and Personal categories are highly negatively correlated, confirming that rides fall into either category but never overlap.  
ðŸ”¹ No strong correlation exists between the other features.  

### 3. Line Plot â€“ Monthly Trends  
ðŸ”¹ Peak in Ride Miles (Total Distance): The longest trips (in terms of miles) happened in April.  
ðŸ”¹ Significant Peaks in October & November: Suggesting increased travel demand (possibly holiday season).  
ðŸ”¹ Dip in Rides during September: Uber usage declined in this month.  

## 4. Count Plot â€“ Rides by Day  
ðŸ”¹ Some days see significantly higher Uber usage, with variations based on time of year and purpose.  

### 5. Histogram â€“ Miles Distribution
ðŸ”¹ Most cabs are booked for distances of 4-5 miles.  
ðŸ”¹ Majority of trips fall within 0-20 miles.  
ðŸ”¹ Trips beyond 20 miles are rare.  

### 6. Seasonal Trends & Possible Explanations  
ðŸ”¹ April and October show high-value counts (indicating long trips).  
ðŸ”¹ November has high total rides, likely due to increased travel during holidays.  
ðŸ”¹ Summer months (June-July) see lower Uber usage, possibly due to vacation periods.
